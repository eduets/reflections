What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It says to git that this is a new repository. We need it to initialize the repository so we can 
make commits and begin using git.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
It is the area between the working directory and the repository. It links only the files that we 
want to be in the repository.
